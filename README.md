# Election_Analysis
## Overview
  ### In this analysis we looked at election data for an election and interpreted the data from a .CSV using Python
  ### Using Python we wrote a script that first looked at the candidates and percentage that they appeared in the table indicating that vote was cast for that particular candidate.  Using python we were able to easily and quickly comb through the data and then specify what parts we wanted to print in the terminal.  This made the data easy to read since python already formatted the data the way we told it to.
  ### After we completed this step we took it further by doing the same thing we did but instead of looking at the canidates and their votes totals we looked at the counties in which the vote came from.
## Analysis
### By using python to run the script we wrote we were able to easily look at the data and read it. From a first glance we can easily see that Diana DeGette ran away with the election with a commanding 73.8% total.  We can also see that one county was above the other two as Denver was responsible for 82.8% of the vote.  If we wanted we could take it a step further and try to corralte the vote totals from the candidates to the counties that voted for them.

## Challenges
### What made this project challenging was writing the script for python to run and making sure there were no errors.  Using visual studio made this easy as it is very user friendly and easy to navigate.  Another challenge was getting the code to talk to Github using commands and making sure that everything that needs to be uploaded gets uploaded properly
